# Pina
A Discord bot that allows anyone to pin messages in your server.

## Why would I need a bot for that?
If you want users to pin message, they must have the "Manage Messages" permission.<br/>
However, that includes the ability to delete messages, so it can be a bit risky to give it to everyone.<br/>
Thanks to this bot, anyone is now able to pin message by writing p.pin or by adding ?? emote to the corresponding message.
